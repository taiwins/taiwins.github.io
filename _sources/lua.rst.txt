Lua bindings
============

Taiwins is currently configed through lua language. refer to
`config <config.lua>`_ as an example.

here are some knowledge about lua c API.
----------------------------------------

You work with a stack when dealing with lua C code, it is annoying sometimes, as
it kinda like writing assembly, but it is what it is.

registry
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   For c programmer, you have registry `LUA_REGISTRYINDEX` to store your data, 
   call `lua_setfile(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, pos)` to set the data.


metatables, **_index** and **__newindex**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   - `metatable` serves the purpose of operator overrides.
   - `__index` is for element access.
   - `__newindex` is for elements assignment. 

   using metatables provides much more syntax sugar for configurations. If you
   decide to override the `__index` and `__newindex` for metatable, you can't
   assign elements into tables after setting metatables anymore. So register
   methods *BEFORE* assigning metatables.

   If you have a global table, placing methods inside the table directly
   instead of inside the metatable would be a good idea. 


To call a lua fuction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* ``lua_getglobal`` : at 0
* ``lua_pushstring`` : at -1. first argument
* ``lua_newtable`` : at -2. second argument
* ``lua_pushtablestring`` operate on table
* ``lua_call`` : clear the stack, call the function then push results onto stack
  for you to retrieve.

to create a lua global variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* ``lua_push*`` : you have some thing on the stack.
* ``lua_setglobal`` : pop that value and sets it as global variable in the lua
  context

to get something in the table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, you can create a new table then set it as global, then to get the
field.


* ``lua_pushstring`` : push the name of that field.
* ``lua_gettable(L, index)`` : use what we pushed onto stack to get the
  field. ``index`` is usually just -2.
* access the value by the index of -1
* ``lua_pop``\ , pop that value.

to set something in the table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* ``lua_newtable`` : create the table
* ``lua_pushstring`` : the name of the field.
* ``lua_push*`` : push a actual value for that field.
* ``lua_settable`` : the index should be -3, points to the table.
* ``lua_setglobal`` : set our table name and pop it from the stack.

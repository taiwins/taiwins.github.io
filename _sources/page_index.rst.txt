.. rubric:: Sub-projects:

Taiwins is consists of multiple subprojects besides the main libtaiwins library. They plays different roles in the taiwins ecosystem and they can also function indepedently of taiwins as well.

* `twclient <https://github.com/taiwins/twclient>`__ is the general purpose wayland client library. It was created to handle the first 500 lines of wayland code before you can draw a ``wl_surface``. Twclient uses an event queue to process incomming events like IO, timer and idle events, it is similar to what is done in the wayland server end. Most of interfaces in wayland client protocols are implemented and it handles the interfaces to implement a shmbuf ``wl_surface`` or EGL ``wl_surface``.
  
  An optional **twclient-icons** library comes with **twclient** for collecting xdg desktop elements like icons, cursor and application entries.

* `twidgets <https://github.com/taiwins/twidgets>`__ is a widget drawing library built upon twclient. It is intented to use as a embedded library in your application. `Nuklear <https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear>`__ is the GUI system of choice. Taiwins itself use the library for creating desktop widgets.

* `taiwins-protocols <https://github.com/taiwins/taiwins-protocols>`__ is the collection of wayland protocols specific to taiwins.

* `tdbus <https://github.com/xeechou/tdbus>`__ is a tiny D-Bus communication library for much simpler interface than raw ``DBusConnection``.

wayland
=======

This page contains various notes about wayland objects and weston implementation. Note that since taiwins is not using **libweston** anymore, the knowledge maybe outdated. The notes is written based on my understanding and I am not a weston developer, thus there could be various misinterpretations.

wayland objects
---------------

The objects creation/destruction should be done with only requests.

* creation:
  
  * you can use ``new_id`` in the ``request``, this is the usual way, returns an object, like ``wl_surface`` creation from ``wl_compositor``.
  
  * having a ``new_id`` in ``event``, passed as an argument, I am supposed to store it. Said not to use it if unnecessary.

* destruction:
  
  * ``wl_foobar_destroy`` request. Usual way, server receives it and have a signal for that.
  
  * create an ``event`` and document it for the client to destroy the proxy. Like ``wl_callback``. The obvious difference is that the protocol has no request at all! Said by PQ in the `blog <http://ppaalanen.blogspot.com/2014/07/wayland-protocol-design-object-lifespan.html>`__. In one phrase: created by clients, destroyed by clients; created by server, disposed by server.

wayland-server implementations
------------------------------



.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md37:

event-loop
++++++++++

``event_loop`` is like what I have in the ``client.c``, it is almost implemented in the same way, it has the ``timer``, ``idle``, ``fd`` (It uses ``pipe2`` for receiving data instead of ``inotify``).

* ``idle`` :

* ``timer`` :





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md38:

wl_client_create
++++++++++++++++

This is the only time you need to explicitly create a client for the given socket, otherwise the clients are created by wayland protocols(I think the socket is created when the first client created(if you look into the ``wl_client_create`` code)). Since you are forced to give a ``fd``, the only way is providing a ``socketpair``.x

weston notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md40:

weston objects
--------------

* ``weston_surface`` is the ``wl_resource`` of ``wl_surface``

* ``weston_output`` is the ``wl_resource`` of the ``wl_output``.



.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md41:

weston_layer
++++++++++++

``weston_layer`` s are stored from top to bottom in the compositor, in that case ``compositor->layer_header->top_layer->...bottom_layer``. The same priority pattern applies within the layer. So the top view is the first view in the layer's ``view_link``. When compositor starts painting, it will build the view_list from all the layers(priority top to down). With the information, the compositor can figure out which parts of the ``weston_plane`` (a ``pixman_region``) are damaged.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md42:

weston_plane
++++++++++++

The ``weston_plane`` is a logical representation of the hardware compositing planes, so we only need to do the compositing on every plane, and the hardware composits the different planes. Currently here is a piece of code inside the ``gl-renderer`` and ``pixman-renderer``.

.. code-block:: none

	wl_list_for_each_reverse(view, compositor->view_list, link)
	    if (view->plane == &compositor->primary_plane)
	        draw_view(view);







.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md43:

weston_output_repaint_loop and discovered problem.
--------------------------------------------------

The surface has to follow the ``frame->attach->damage->commit->done`` loop! If done happen after next commit, the client will having trouble waiting the done event for the corresponding frame, it lags the rendering.



.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md44:

if you want to unmap the view
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is okay if all the operation is transparent to client. The compositor suddenly unmap the view and remap the view, clients just get paused, nothing wrong happens.







.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md45:

weston coordinate system.
-------------------------

weston should have 3 different coord system, since they are all 2D, it shouldn't be hard.



.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md46:

compositor space (global space, it is global ).
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md47:

output space
++++++++++++





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md48:

view space (globalx - view->geometry.x).
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

related function:

* ``weston_view_to_global_{fixed,float,int}`` :: map a local view coordinate to global coordinate.

* ``weston_view_from_global_{fixed,float,int}`` :: map a global coordinate to view coordinate.

* ``weston_compositor_pick_view`` :: search the view in the view list and return the local coordinate of the view.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md49:

weston_pointer
++++++++++++++

It has ``x,y``, ``grab_x, grab_y``, ``sx,sy`` 3 coordinates, the last one for its focused view, you can use ``weston_view_from_global_fixed(pointer->focused, pointer->x, pointer->y, &pointer->sy)`` if neccessary.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md50:

Weston-desktop API
++++++++++++++++++

The API reassembles the ``xdg_shell_protocols`` protocol, but it internally glued the ``wl_shell``, ``xdg_shell_v5`` and ``xdg_shell_v6`` under one implementation, by exposing a common API, a compositor can drive multiple desktop protocols.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md51:

wl_frame
++++++++

The key function is ``weston_output_repaint``. You will see the accumulation of ``frame_callback``, ``weston_compositor_build_view_list``, and call to ``renderer->repaint``, then send done to all the ``frame_callback``.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md52:

weston-renderer implementation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The one key function to look at is the ``weston_output_repaint``. This is the frame callback, called in maybe ``eventloop``. It does a few things:

* it need to build up the ``view_list`` of current frame, extract from layers, and sort them in order.

* move views to planes, if backend supports multiple planes, it does that.

* initialize the ``frame_callback`` list, this is where the ``frame_done`` gets sent

* next it accumenate the damage, when you set ``weston_view_damage_ below``, it gets accumulated here.

* Then it calls renderer to repaint.

* sends all the ``frame_callbacks``.

* output has an animation list. It does that as well.





.. _doxid-dd/d57/md__home_developer__projects_web-taiwins_taiwins_docs_wayland_1autotoc_md53:

weston-view coordinates
+++++++++++++++++++++++

see the ``compositor_accumulate_damamge``, there is nothing about output weston_view has a geometry, this geometry is in global coordinates.

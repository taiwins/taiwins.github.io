Taiwins wayland objects library
===============================

This library implements basic wayland protocols as well as various other wayland protocols like 'xdg-shell' and 'linux-dmabuf'. The library is designed to be backend agnostic and autonomous. That is, it does not depend on a wayland backend to work. It also exposes as few APIs as possible for easy intergration into a compositor.

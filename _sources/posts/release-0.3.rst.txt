Taiwins 0.3 release
===================

I am glad to announce that Taiwins 0.3 is released today. It has been a year
since Taiwins 0.1 release, we have migrated from libweston and wlroots. today,
Taiwins has implemented enough compositor features it has became my main
compositor. The biggest change in the version is the libtaiwins library is
finally ready for a daily use.

1. Multiple backends for hardware abstraction(DRM, X11, wayland).
2. Rendering context with exposed interface for custom rendering.
3. Abstracting ``xdg-surface``, ``wl_shell_surface`` and ``xwayland_surface``
   for unified desktop interface.
4. session handling.
5. All essential and many useful wayland protocols.
6. Xwayland support.

With those features supported, libtaiwins now becomes a real alternative
outsides wlroots and libweston. Besides, I'd like to point out some design
goals were kept in mind when crafting taiwins since day 1.

- split GBM buffer management from DRM mode setting, make it possible to
  implement other buffer management backends.
- builtin support for multi-GPUs from day one.
- udev events monitoring for runtime GPU events handling.
- separate rendering logic from backends, make it possible to work with
  different renderers.

On this website, you could also find many useful documentations regarding
libtaiwins architecture and API design.

Taiwins compositor, on the other hand, supports its unique features, you can
find the complete taiwins feature set `here <feature-set_>`_.

The next version of taiwins will focus on the rendering side. Features
hopefully will land includes:

- xdg-decoration support
- plane assignment in drm backend
- video recording feature
- taiwins shell functionalities
- and more

  
Previous releases
-----------------

Since There were no release notes util now, I think there is need to brief the
history of taiwins releases.

Taiwins 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the inherited function limitation posed by libweston and it changed
header and link path every release. Taiwins need to move from libweston
dependent. On Sept-22, 2020, the version 0.2 was out. It was an transitional
release based on wlroots because taiwins would need a COMPLETELY rewrite if to
settle on wlroots. Instead, the strategy was to rely on wlroots for hardware
abstraction only and implementing wayland protocols using libtaiwins. The
feature included in this release:

- dynamic window management (both tiling and floating).
- extensible configuration using lua.
- efficient renderer, updates only on damage.
- builtin shell and application launcher.
- theme configuration.
- emacs like keybinding system.
- builtin profiler.

Taiwins 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~

On May-13, 2020. The first version of taiwins compositor is released. Taiwins then
was built upon libweston. All the backend/rendering was done by libweston,
taiwins then was focusing on writing a custom shell using `twclient
<twclient_>`_ and implementing custom window management.

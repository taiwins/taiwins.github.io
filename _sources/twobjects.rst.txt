Twobjects quick reference
=========================

Twobjects is the result of migration taiwins from **libweston**\ , as libweston
has many constrains, lacks of important features and has several severe bugs
for daily users. Firstly I looked into **wlroots** and found it does not fit
the design of taiwins, inspired by the two prior project. I created this
library for faciliting the development of the wayland compositor. It is now
merged inside libtaiwins.

Features
--------


* twobjects implements all the interfaces in the ``wayland.xml`` and several
  .. code-block::

       important protocols such as `xdg-shell` and `linux-dmabuf`.

* twobjects is designed to backend agnositc, you can stack it on top of other
  .. code-block::

       backend implementation such as wlroots.

* twobjects is designed to be autonomous. Unlike wlroots approach, which heavily
  exposes ``wl_signal`` from protocols so the users still has to write a layer of
  glue to use them. In twobjects, many of wayland protocols manages itself thus
  transparent to the backend developer. A good example is ``wl_data_device``.
* twobjects has built-in logging and profiling system and other utilites.

Building
--------

Install dependencies:


* meson
* wayland
* wayland-protocols
* xkbcommon
* libdrm 
* pixman

Commands for build:

.. code-block::

   meson build
   ninja -C build


Commands for install:

.. code-block::

   sudo ninja -C build install


Getting started
---------------

Many protocols essentially implements a ``wl_global`` object like ``wl_compositor``
in the compositor, twobjects typically implements a corresponding type like
``tw_compositor``. You can create the static global by using function like
``tw_compositor_create_global`` or allocate the memory yourself then use
``tw_compositor_init``. 

There are some cases where twobjects abstracts several protocols into common
interface for users. For example, the ``tw_desktop_manager`` implements both
``wl_shell`` and ``xdg_shell`` and exposes ``tw_desktop_surface`` for the user, this
is similar to the design of libweston.

For "middle-man" protocols like ``wl_data_device``\ , the internals or managing
``wl_data_source``\ , ``wl_data_offer`` is transparent to user. Users simply
initialize the ``tw_data_manager`` for getting the clipboard in wayland.

Twobjects utilities
-------------------

Twobjects implements utilies like matrix, cursor, logging and profiling
functions for users. Check out the headers for usage.

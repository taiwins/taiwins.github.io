    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, if you are reading this, I assume you are interested in the window system
on your computer. In the wayland world, it is called compositor. I found it is
a bit misleading since this system does way much more than just
compositing. But anyway, this series of tutorial will teach you how to write
one using wayland using libtaiwins. It may sound complicated, but &lt;em&gt;bear that in
mind&lt;/em&gt;, in the beginning of 2020 when I started creating libtaiwins, I probably
didn’t know more than you how to do it either.&lt;/p&gt;
